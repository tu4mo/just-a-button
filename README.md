# It's just a button

Technologies used:

- React with TypeScript

- styled-components, emotion, CSS Modules and Tailwind CSS for styling
- Google Fonts for a web font
- Localized with react-i18next
- Redux Toolkit to change button clicked state
- Recoil to change button click count
- Valtio to flip background color
- stylelint with:
  - configs: recommended, prettier, styled-components
  - plugins: order
- commitlint to enforce conventional commit messages
- Github Actions for deployment
